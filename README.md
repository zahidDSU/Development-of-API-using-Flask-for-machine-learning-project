# Development of API using Flask for Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a RESTful API using Flask, a popular Python web framework, to serve a machine learning model. The API allows users to interact with the model, make predictions, and retrieve results through HTTP requests. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and using the API.

## Features
- Exposes a machine learning model via a RESTful API.
- Supports various endpoints for model predictions and interactions.
- Easily extendable to incorporate additional machine learning models.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Required machine learning libraries and dependencies

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Development-of-API-using-Flask-for-machine-learning-project.git
